####  Questions

>  What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes or camels)


A:    camelCase


>  If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?


A:  var mentor = ‘Alex Rolfe’;


>  How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?


A:    console.log(mentor);


>  Describe the difference between let, var, and const.


A:    
* The ‘let’ variable allows us to scope a variable to a particular code block, or set of curly brackets {}.

* The ‘var’ variable is scoped to the entire function, or global scope if declared outside of a function.

* We use ‘const’ to declare a variable that we won’t reassign.


#### Code Practice

> Using var, let and const create 3 variables that will hold your name, state, and hair color.

####   Code
```JS
var name = 'Kim';
const state = 'California';
let hairColor = 'auburn';
```
