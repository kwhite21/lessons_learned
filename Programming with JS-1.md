>  Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before:
What are the steps involved in making a phone call?


A:
1. Select the person you want to call, or look up their phone number.
1. Enter the number.
1. Dial the number/make the call.
1. When person answers, begin speaking.
1. Hang up the phone when call has ended.


>  In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the cause of the problem? Explain the process and use a roadmap to visualize it.


A:  I would start at the “Say Hi” portion of code.  If I couldn’t find anything wrong there, I’d keep working backwards until I find the last step that worked correctly.  Then I would know that the issue is in a step that follows.


>  Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.


A:    In my current line of work, we often find discrepancies on our invoices to clients.  When I encounter this kind of problem, these are the steps I take to resolve the issue:

1. Calculate the amount of discrepancy.
1. If I can’t pinpoint the discrepancy by amount, I will then try to identify which section of my invoice is incorrect i.e. previous billed, current billed, retention.
1. After narrowing it down, I check my entries line by line in that section for numbers entered incorrectly.
1. I mark any changes made and see if that resolves the discrepancy.  This usually does the trick.
