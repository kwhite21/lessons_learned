####  Questions
>  Why would you want to use version control for your code?

A:    It allows for the tracking of changes in a project, and makes collaboration between multiple developers more efficient.

>  Where can you find additional information about the Git commands available?

A:  You can use the GitHub Git cheat sheet, or google ‘Git commands’ for more information.

>  Why are branches useful?

A:    They allow us to work on a feature while giving us the opportunity to keep or discard our work later on.

>  What is the purpose of a remote?

A:    To link and push up a local repository to GitHub by passing in the name of the remote and its URL.

>  Why is it important to track changes to the upstream repository after you create your initial fork?

A:    Because the local master might be out of date with the repository I forked.  To fix this, I’ll need to run code to add the ‘upstream’ as a remote branch (original project location) so I can get their updates into my branch.
